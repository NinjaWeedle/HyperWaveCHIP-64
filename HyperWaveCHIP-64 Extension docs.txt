HyperWaveCHIP-64 specification

By oxiti8

This extension builds off of HYPERCHIP-64, which builds off of XO-CHIP 1.1.

NEW OPS:

5XY1: Skip if VX > VY. Will also skip over the F000 instruction (long i). Inherited from CHIP8E.

8XYC: Set VX to VX * VY. If result is over 256, Set VF to Floor of (result / 256), and set VX to (VX modulo 256). If not, set VF to 0.

8XYD: Set VX to VX / VY. If result is over 256, Set VF to VX mod VY. If VY = 0 at the start of the opcode, set BOTH VX and VF to 0. Prevents division by zero.

FN03: Change color of palette n to Join [I], [I+1], [I+2]  Set RGB color for plane # N to join [I](R) [I+1],(G) [I+2](B)

For FN03, the value of N (Ranging from 0-15) represents which palette is being modified. Here's a guide:
N = 0: The palette used for the Background color (Background in Octo)
N = 1: The palette for Plane 1 only (Foreground 1 in Octo)
N = 2: The palette for Plane 2 only (Foreground 2 in Octo)
N = 3: The palette for Plane 3 (Blended in Octo)
This can and most likely will be extended for 4 bitplanes later. The structure of the opcode allows for 4 bitplanes and 16 colors maximum.
