HyperWaveCHIP-64 specification

By oxiti8

This extension builds off of HYPERCHIP-64, which builds off of XO-CHIP 1.1.

NEW OPS:

5XY1: Skip if VX > VY. Will also skip over the F000 instruction (long i). Inherited from CHIP8E.

8XYC: Set VX to VX * VY. If result is over 256, Set VF to Floor of (result / 256), and set VX to (VX modulo 256). If not, set VF to 0.

8XYD: Set VX to VX / VY. If result is over 256, Set VF to VX mod VY. If VY = 0 at the start of the opcode, set BOTH VX and VF to 0. Prevents division by zero.

FN03: Change color of plane n to Join [I], [I+1], [I+2]  Set RGB color for plane # N to join [I](R) [I+1],(G) [I+2](B)
