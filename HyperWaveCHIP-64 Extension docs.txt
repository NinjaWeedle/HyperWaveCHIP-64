HyperWaveCHIP-64 specification

By oxiti8

THis extension builds off of HYPERCHIP-64, which builds off of XO-CHIP 1.1.

NEW OPS:

5XY1: Skip if VX > VY. Will also skip over the F000 instruction (long i). Inherited from CHIP8E.

8XYC: Set VX to VX * VY. If result is over 256, Set VF to Floor of (result / 256), and set VX to (VX modulo 256). If not, set VF to 0.

8XYD: Set VX to VX / VY. If result is over 256, Set VF to Floor of (result / 256), and set VX to (VX modulo 256). If not, set VF to 0.
